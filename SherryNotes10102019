part of reason why we see diff in 20 year olds cuz of cohort for 10-19 yo;
what happens if we use same cohort measures across all age groups; take your cohorts mortality eg 10-=20 mortality for everything?

use your self when you were 10-20 instead of your health in the preceeding decade?

look at canada england aus;
how detaile cause of death by age and cohort for anglophone places and years;
restrict current analysis to just anglophone countries and see whats up


Now that I have data on mortality in anglophone; focus on external causes codes
