## Meeting One
Idea that the mortality for the cohort 10 years earlier; controls flexibly for cohort quality.

Unsure about econometrically? This is some kind of AR1 or AR2 process?
Then we have fixed effects and then it gets weird?

Treat all countries that are not the US as one; Dump the countries and convert it to dummy of US vs Not US

We see the differential is getting worse for 20-39 year olds


### Male.jpg
You see a fanning out; starts from the young and then go old?

#### Hypothesis that this is something that is affecting young people such as labor market,

Is there a way to? Given the other things in the regression

coef on chort is capturing year effect as well
we also have the coefficient for year so what takes care of the problem?


####What have we learned that we didnt learn before?
US departs from other countries trend wise in 1980s. We're kind of saying there are some differences by age, gender, etc, but overall the story is essentially we leave at 1980.

In relative terms this is much worse for young people;

Difference between cohort and non cohort controls is novel.

Try and control for other characteristics of these countries over time such as
economy, education levels by age, gini, ??

Paper that focuses on labor market effects to read? Matched profiles of mortality with unemployment rates at the time you're 18ish? Find unemployment rates for everyone at each age group for a handful of countries

Young people die more in the short term in bad economic times; alot of that has to do with accidents  

Option one; write and go
Option two; do a handful of countries for economic conditions
Option three; More detailed information on stuff like mortality by cause

angus something;
What happened to people in these age groups diferentially?
Young people usually get external causes of death?

Im going to go write a memo of what is known and find out what data are available

there should be unemployment data and cause of death data;
